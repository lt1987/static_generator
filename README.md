# static_generator
Description
This is a simple program that takes a text string and creates a static image from the character values. Plans to improve code in the future. This was born from the desire to not use a stock photo as a LinkedIN profile picture and still obscure my face. Can be used as a general placeholder or tool to counter image searches.
